Drug-Drug Interactions: The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between @DRUG$ capsules and other @DRUG$ have not been determined. 	0
However, interactions may be expected and @DRUG$ capsules should NOT be used in combination with other @DRUG$. 	3
The pharmacokinetic interaction between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ capsules was investigated. 	0
Therefore, @DRUG$ capsules should be used with caution in combination with @DRUG$, particularly at doses higher than 0.4 mg. 	3
Results from limited in vitro and in vivo drug-drug interaction studies between @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ are inconclusive. 	0
Therefore, caution should be exercised with concomitant administration of @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ capsules.        	3
The concomitant use of @DRUG$ with other @DRUG$ or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. 	4

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the psychostimulant drug @DRUG$ has any effect on @DRUG$-induced antinociception and locomotor inhibitor activity in mice in acute application.	0

In the hot plate test in mice, co-administration of 15     g/kg @DRUG$ with 10   mg/kg @DRUG$ intraperitoneally not only enhanced, but also prolonged the duration of antinociception induced by dexmedetomidine. 	4
In the hot plate test in mice, co-administration of 15     g/kg @DRUG$ with 10   mg/kg ephedrine intraperitoneally not only enhanced, but also prolonged the duration of antinociception induced by @DRUG$. 	0
In the hot plate test in mice, co-administration of 15     g/kg dexmedetomidine with 10   mg/kg @DRUG$ intraperitoneally not only enhanced, but also prolonged the duration of antinociception induced by @DRUG$. 	0
At the same time, the locomotor inhibitory effect of @DRUG$ was counteracted by @DRUG$. 	4
We concluded that the combined administration of @DRUG$ with @DRUG$ may have beneficial effects in the treatment of pain without causing sedation, which limits the use of dexmedetomidine as an analgesic in humans.	4
