Antiaggressive activity of central @CHEM-GENE$ in male rats.	0
RATIONALE: A substantial body of research suggests that the neuropeptide @CHEM-GENE$ promotes social affiliative behaviors in a wide range of animals including humans.	0
OBJECTIVE: Our primary goal was to examine the putative serenic effect of @CHEM-GENE$ in a feral strain (wild type Groningen, WTG) of rats that generally show a much broader variation and higher levels of intermale aggression than commonly used laboratory strains of rats.	0
METHODS: Resident animals were intracerebroventricularly (icv) administered with different doses of synthetic @CHEM-GENE$ and oxytocin receptor antagonist, alone and in combination, in order to manipulate brain oxytocin functioning and to assess their behavioral response to an intruder.	0

METHODS: Resident animals were intracerebroventricularly (icv) administered with different doses of synthetic oxytocin and oxytocin receptor antagonist, alone and in combination, in order to manipulate brain @CHEM-GENE$ functioning and to assess their behavioral response to an intruder.	0
RESULTS: Our data clearly demonstrate that acute icv administered @CHEM-GENE$ produces dose-dependent and receptor-selective changes in social behavior, reducing aggression and potentiating social exploration.	0
On the other hand, administration of an @CHEM-GENE$ antagonist tends to increase (nonsignificantly) aggression only in low-medium aggressive animals.	0
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that transiently enhancing brain @CHEM-GENE$ function has potent antiaggressive effects, whereas its attenuation tends to enhance aggressiveness.	0
This study supports the suggestion that @CHEM-GENE$ agonists could clinically be useful for curbing heightened aggression seen in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders like antisocial personality disorder, autism, and addiction.	0
