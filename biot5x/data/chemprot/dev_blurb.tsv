The objective of this study was to examine the turnover of the @CHEMICAL$ transporter (@GENE$) by determining its production rate (r), degradation rate constant (k) and half-life of recovery (t1/2).	0
The turnover of @GENE$ was determined from the rate of recovery of binding after administration of @CHEMICAL$, an irreversible inhibitor of ligand binding.	2
In preliminary studies, in vitro incubation of rat cerebral cortex with @CHEMICAL$ produced a wash and temperature resistant inhibition of @GENE$ binding densities (Bmax).	2
@CHEMICAL$ protected against the RTI-76-induced inhibition of @GENE$ binding.	0
Citalopram protected against the @CHEMICAL$-induced inhibition of @GENE$ binding.	2
Following 6 h of in vivo intracerebroventricular injections of 100 nmol of @CHEMICAL$, there was a dose- and time-dependent reduction (- 60%) of @GENE$ binding in hippocampus and striatum, without a change in the Kd.	0
The decrease and recovery of @CHEMICAL$ uptake correlated highly (r = 0.93) with the recovery of @GENE$ binding.	5
