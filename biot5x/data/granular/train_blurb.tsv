Here we use a fragment - based drug discovery approach using nucleic magnetic resonance , X - ray crystallography and structure - based compound optimization to generate a new family of non - peptidic , small - molecule cyclophilin inhibitors with potent in vitro PPIase inhibitory activity and antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus , human immunodeficiency virus and coronaviruses .
